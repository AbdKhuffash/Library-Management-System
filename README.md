# Library Management System (LMS) 
## Abstract/Objectives
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Library Management System (LMS). The aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Python code, exploring its key features. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, and in this project, we utilize these features to develop an efficient LMS.

## Theory
The Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to efficiently manage library operations. It provides functionalities such as adding books to the library collection, searching for books, editing book information, archiving books, generating reports, and more. The Python code provided in this repository implements the LMS.

## Code Overview
The code consists of two main files: "main.py" and "Library.py".

"main.py": Contains the main program logic.
"Library.py": Defines the Library class and its methods.

## Conclusion
The implemented Library Management System (LMS) provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for efficiently managing library operations. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming and file handling techniques to create a user-friendly and efficient LMS.
